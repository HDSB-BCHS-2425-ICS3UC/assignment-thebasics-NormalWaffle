#the float data type stores a number with a decimal point, up to 7 digits
x = 5.6
print("x is a float, it stores a number with a decimal point, in this case", x)

#the double data type stores a number with a decimal point, up to 16 digits
y = 6.77655575555757
print("y is also a float, but it stores more digits after the decimal point, in this case it is the number", y)

#the string data type stores a string of characters, like a word or several words
z = "Monkey"
